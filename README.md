Instruction:
Using typescript, create a class component and a functional component. The class component should reach out to the Geolocation API (Links to an external site.) to grab your coordinates. Then using those coordinates, reach out to the Open Weather API (Links to an external site.) and retrieve the weather information for your area.  Once you have the weather, it should be sent to the functional component to be displayed.
